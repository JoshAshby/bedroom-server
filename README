Included in here is a few of the web pages I have on my bedroomserver. these are for our local network only, and mainly for testing different bits of code. I have included the main files, such as Perl, and PHP that hold Perl related code, or PHP related code. For some of the perl code bits, you'll need to install different modules, the easiest way to install them is with the cpan module, which if your using this code you should know where your web servers perl is located and where it's cpan module is, and how to use the cpan module. :) Theres not much PHP code as it doesn't seem to interest me as much as perl does.
